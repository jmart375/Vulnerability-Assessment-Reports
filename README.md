# Vulnerability Assessment Reports

## CentOS vulnerability assessment report:
The vulnerability assessment for CentOS- based hosts identified 19 vulnerabilities across the scanned IP addresses. Vulnerabilities were categorized into low and informational severity levels. The low severity issues were related to weak key exchange algorithms and CBC mode ciphers in the SSH server configuration. To mitigate these, the weak algorithms should be disabled, and CBC motorcycle encryption should be replaced with Ctr. or GCM cipher mode.

## Kali vulnerability assessment report: 
The vulnerability assessment for Kali Linux identified 40 vulnerabilities across the scan IP addresses. These vulnerabilities mainly include informational findings related to SSL certificate trust, Apache HTTP server installations, and site enumeration. 

## Domain controller vulnerability assessment report: 
The domain controller and file server vulnerability assessment identified 263 vulnerabilities across the scan IP addresses. The vulnerabilities included critical and high severity issues related to outdated security updates for Windows and Linux kernels. To mitigate these, FMJ2 Net Shield recommended promptly applying the necessary security patches to ensure network security and protect against potential exploitation.

## Ubuntu and Windows Vulnerability assessment report: 
The vulnerability assessment for Ubuntu and Windows hosts revealed 40 vulnerabilities on Ubuntu and 79 vulnerabilities on Windows. The Ubuntu vulnerabilities were primarily informational, covering network enumeration, software detection, and SSH configuration. FMJ2 Net Shield recommended addressing these informational issues to enhance the systemâ€™s security and prevent potential exploitation.


# Detailed Report

## Introduction
A vulnerability assessment report details the findings from a systematic evaluation of vulnerabilities within Design World's system, network, and applications. This identifies weaknesses and security issues that can compromise the physical and software base environment, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to steal, change, or disrupt services. The assessment report is a valuable tool for risk mitigation, resource allocation, and continuous improvement of Design World's security.

FMJ2 ran a network-based scan with the following subnets:
- 172.16.102.0/24
- 172.16.120.0/24

The number of hosts discovered (20) exceeded the Nexxus Essentials license limit of 16 IP scans. With the project manager's discretion (Josue), the decision was made to scan selected IP addresses, and the remaining addresses were not included in this report. Future funding is sought to purchase an enterprise-level license for more advanced scans.

## Vulnerability Assessment Details

### CentOS Servers
- Host 172.16.102.58 vulnerabilities: 2 Low, 17 Info
- Host 172.16.102.162 vulnerabilities: 2 Low, 1 Info
- Host 172.16.120.79 vulnerabilities: 1 Medium, 24 Info

After applying updates and upgrades, vulnerabilities were found with associated hosts. Mitigations are detailed for each vulnerability.

### Domain Controller and File Server (DC/FC)
- Host 172.16.102.67 vulnerabilities: 42 Critical, 68 High
- Host 172.16.102.118 vulnerabilities: 41 Critical, 66 High

The top five domain controllers and file servers are identified as potential security risks due to outdated software. Recommendations include regular patching and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities.

### Kali Linux
- Host 172.16.102.127 vulnerabilities: 1 Medium, 47 Info
- Host 172.16.102.209 vulnerabilities: 3 Info

Kali is an essential tool in the network security arsenal. Due to licensing restrictions, optimization of its usage is recommended by limiting its scope to specific Kali boxes.

### Ubuntu
- Host 172.16.102.103 vulnerabilities: 40 Info
- Host 172.16.102.214 vulnerabilities: 1 High, 42 Info

Vulnerabilities on Ubuntu hosts are informational and include a high severity vulnerability related to Linux kernel vulnerabilities.

### Windows
- Host 172.16.102.50 vulnerabilities: 2 High, 70 Info
- Host 172.16.102.55 vulnerabilities: 2 High, 70 Info
- Host 172.16.102.129 vulnerabilities: 2 High, 70 Info
- Host 172.16.102.157 vulnerabilities: 2 High, 70 Info

Windows PCs are susceptible to various security risks involving SSL certificates, TLS protocols, and SMB signing.

## Conclusion & Next Steps
Based on Nessus scanner findings, the environment needs to implement a patching schedule. Multiple hosts running past end-of-life OS versions expose Design World's network to attacks. The next steps include scanning the environment for configurations that can be tweaked to improve SCAP compliance with the respected STIG.
